  "summary": "Sure, here is a summary of the video:\n\n**Overview**\nThe video explains the differences between an AI agent and agentic AI, as well as the differences in terms of their functions.\n\n**Key Points**\n- The presenter defines AI agent as an independent system or tool that can handle only one specific job autonomously and it has a predefined set of rules and goals. \n- Examples of an AI agent include an AI chatbot or an AI agent which can help to write a resume.\n- On the other hand, agentic AI is not just one agent. It is a design approach which handles the entire workflow.\n- Agentic AI is considered as a team working together to get you hired, using research agents, custom resume creation, and interview preparation. \n- Bottom line, AI agents prefer to work alone. On the other hand, agentic AI prefers to collaborate as a team.",
