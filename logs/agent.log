Sure, here is a summary of the video:

**Topic**
The video discusses the differences between AI Agents and Agentic AI.

**AI Agents**
- An AI Agent is an independent system or tool.
- It can handle only one specific job autonomously.
- It has a predefined set of rules and goals.
- One example of an AI agent is a resume writer, which only requires the input of skills.

**Agentic AI**
- Agentic AI is not just one agent, but a design approach that handles the entire workflow.
- When multiple AI agents collaborate together, like a team, that becomes an Agentic AI.
- AI Agents will debate, refine, and iterate on the tasks.
- Agentic AI can be considered as a team working to get the user hired.
- The first agent is a research agent, which will provide market analysis.
- The second agent will write the custom resume based on the job descriptions.
- The third agent will help the user prepare for interviews.

**Bottom Line**
- AI agents operate independently, handling tasks on their own.
- Agentic AI assembles teams of AI agents to collaboratively tackle complex problems.

=== SUMMARY @ 2025-08-26T16:19:23.413629 ===
Sure, here is the summary of the video in markdown format.

### AI Agents
- An AI agent is an independent system or tool.
- AI agents can handle only one specific job autonomously.
- They have predefined rules and goals.
- An example of an AI agent is an AI agent which helps me write my resume by just inputting my skill set.

### Agentic AI
- Is not just one agent, it is a design approach which handles the entire workflow.
- When multiple AI agents collaborate together like a team we have got our agentic AI.
- They debate, refine, and iterate on tasks.
- An example of an agentic AI is a team working together to get you hired.
- One agent will have is a research agent, which will give you the market analysis. The next agent will help you write the custom resumes based on the job descriptions, and the third agent will help you prepare for interviews.

### Bottom Line
- AI agent says let me handle it by myself and agentic AI says "hey team, assemble and let's collaborate and give and solve this complex problem"

Sure, here is a summary of the video:

**Topic:**
The difference between AI agents and Agentic AI.

**Key Points:**
- People often mix up AI agents and Agentic AI.
- By the end of the video, you'll understand the difference once and for all.

**AI Agents:**
- An independent system or tool that can handle only one specific job autonomously.
- Has a predefined set of rules and goals.
- Example: An AI agent that helps you write a resume by just inputting your skill set.

**Agentic AI:**
- Not just one agent.
- A design approach that handles the entire workflow.
- Multiple AI agents collaborate together like a team.
- They debate, refine, and iterate on the tasks.
- Example: A team working together to get you hired.
  -  One agent (a research agent) gives you the market analysis.
  - The next agent helps you write the custom resumes based on the job descriptions.
  - The third agent helps you prepare for interviews.
- This is how you'll get the collective output to help you land your jobs.

**The Bottom Line:**
- AI agent says, "Let me handle it by myself."
- Agentic AI says, "Hey team, assemble and let's collaborate and give and solve this complex problem."

=== SUMMARY @ 2025-09-23T23:17:33.492080 ===
Sure, here is a summary of the video:

**Overview**
The video explains the differences between an AI agent and agentic AI, as well as the differences in terms of their functions.

**Key Points**
- The presenter defines AI agent as an independent system or tool that can handle only one specific job autonomously and it has a predefined set of rules and goals. 
- Examples of an AI agent include an AI chatbot or an AI agent which can help to write a resume.
- On the other hand, agentic AI is not just one agent. It is a design approach which handles the entire workflow.
- Agentic AI is considered as a team working together to get you hired, using research agents, custom resume creation, and interview preparation. 
- Bottom line, AI agents prefer to work alone. On the other hand, agentic AI prefers to collaborate as a team.
